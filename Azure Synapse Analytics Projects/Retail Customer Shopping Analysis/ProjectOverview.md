# Retail Customer Shopping Analysis – Azure Synapse Analytics

This project analyzes a retail chain's customer shopping data from Istanbul to uncover:
- Top revenue-generating product categories.
- Spending patterns by age and gender.
- Most popular payment methods per location.

The project uses **Azure Synapse Analytics** with **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** to store, transform, and query large-scale datasets, and Power BI for visualization.

## Dataset

Fields:
- `invoice_no`: Invoice ID
- `date`: Purchase date
