# Azure Synapse Analytics Project: Retail Customer Shopping Analysis

This project demonstrates my expertise in using Azure Synapse Analytics to analyze retail customer shopping data, focusing on a real-world dataset from Kaggle to derive insights into customer behavior and sales trends. Using an Azure free account with $200 credit for 30 days, I set up a cost-free Synapse workspace, integrated it with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and explored analytics workflows without incurring costs by using the Kaggle Customer Shopping Dataset and avoiding query execution. This portfolio showcases a practical retail use case, including data ingestion, exploration, pipeline design, and architecture visualization.

## Introduction

In the retail industry, analyzing customer shopping data is essential for optimizing inventory, personalizing marketing, and driving sales growth. Azure Synapse Analytics provides a unified platform for data integration, storage, and analytics. 

This porject illustrates how a retail business can use Azure Synapse to:

Ingest and store customer shopping data from Kaggle’s Customer Shopping Dataset in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Explore data using Synapse Studio’s serverless SQL pool.
Design a ETL pipeline for transforming raw data into actionable insights.
Visualize the architecture to support retail analytics.

All activities were performed cost-free by leveraging the Azure free account, using the serverless SQL pool without executing queries, and deleting resources after capturing screenshots.

## Business Scenario: Retail Customer Shopping Analysis

**Problem Statement :** A retail chain in Istanbul wants to analyze customer shopping data to understand purchasing patterns, customer demographics, and sales trends across shopping malls. Key questions include:

- **Which product categories generate the highest revenue?**
- **How do purchase amounts vary by customer age and gender?**
- **What are the most popular payment methods by location?**

**Solution:**

Using Azure Synapse Analytics, I created a workspace to:
- Store the Kaggle Customer Shopping Dataset (customer_shopping_data.csv) in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- Explore the dataset using serverless SQL queries.
- Design an ETL pipeline to transform raw data into a structured format for analysis.
- Visualize the setup with an architecture diagram.
